                                                         ** UNIFIED DATA QUALITY ANALYZER**

🔹 **Overview**

The Unified Data Quality Analyzer is a data profiling and quality assessment tool built using Python and Flet.
It helps users quickly understand the health, cleanliness, and reliability of CSV datasets through interactive tables and visual analysis.
The project focuses on explainable, logic-based data quality checks instead of heavy machine learning.

🔹 **What Problem Does This Solve?**

In real-world projects, datasets often contain:

◉ Missing values

◉ Duplicate records

◉ Invalid formats (emails, phone numbers, etc.)

◉ Redundant columns

◉ Hidden data inconsistencies

This tool allows users to detect these issues early, before using the data for analytics, BI, or ML.
